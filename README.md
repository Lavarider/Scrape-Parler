# Scrape-Parler

After the removal of MST and JST tokens as a viable way to scrape parler data, there is no current way to scrape Parler. I will be adding functionality to this selenium-based solution which I patched together in an hour. It can currently scrape all the "parleys" of a group of users. It is still quite buggy and Pull requests are welcomed.
